# Hardware

This section presents the hardware components used to run an S4CCS instace. These components are the detectors, the acquisition computers, and the optical fiber set.

## Detectors

The detectors used by SPARC4 are four Frame Transfer (FT) iXon Ultra 888 Electron Multiplying CCD (EMCCD) cameras, of 1024 x 1024 pixels of 13 &mu;m, produced by Oxford Instruments company. These cameras have a window and a coating optimized for the spectral band where they operate, which are similar to the g, r, i, and z bands of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric system. These devices have the Electron Multiplying option, which allows the amplification of the acquired signal. Also, they have the FT option, which allows the acquisition of an exposure happens simultaneously with the reading of the previous one. For this reason, date acqiosition can be done with a maximum acquisition rate of 27 fps, for full-frame images. 

Tabela Below, all the parameters of the cameras operation mode are presented. These parameters are presented in the engineering tab of the S4GUI. Each line lists the keyword that represents a given parameter, the possible values in the first brackets, the default value in the second brackets, and a brief description of the parameter.

## Computers
There are four acquisition computers. They have been acquired using Fapemig funds and their model are Dell Server Poweredge R440: Intel 4108; RAM 16GB; 3 HDD 2TB; OME Server ConfigMgmt; Win Ser 2016; iDRAC9 Enterprise. 

## Fiber optic set 
The fiber optic set is composed of a cable of 50 m of optical fiber, a converter from fiber cable to USB 3.0 cable, and the PCI Express plate. The specifications of the fiber set can be viewed in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14uqgvXuZYkZz6ZpClSB4r5PszCqede9I/view?usp=sharing).
If the PCI Express plate is installed in a computer, the converter should be energized, otherwise the computer is not able to start. Also, the converter should not be turned off while the computer is on. If this happens, the computer will freeze and reboot. For more information, see this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8MHF6c-eTaa6kjQiAshKDKzEIM9V5fIWD2VZ3ULVRY/edit?usp=sharing).
